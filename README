mpssh - Mass Parallel Secure Shell. (c) 2005-2009 Niki Denev <ndenev@gmail.com>

This program reads list of machines from text file (one hostname at line)
and connects to all of the machines by creating upto N parallel ssh
sessions. Then it reads the output from each ssh session and prints it on
the screen prepending the machine name and the descriptor name (stdout/err).
The number of parallel sessions N, the filename of the list of machine
and the username to login as are user configurable on the command line.
You are also able to specify the user in the host file (user@host).

mpssh uses the ssh binary from the openssh package.
there are no other external dependancies
