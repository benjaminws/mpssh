.Op Fl u Ar username

.Sh DESCRIPTION

The
.Nm
utility uses the ssh binary to connect to a number of hosts (specified in the hosts file) and execute <command> on each of them.

A list of flags and arguments with description: 
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Fl b
This flag enables "blind" mode, in which no output from the remote hosts is made to the screen. This mode can only be enabled if the
.Fl o
flag is used, so the output is saved to disk. 
.It Fl e
With this flag
.Nm
prints the return codes of the remotely executed commands.
.It Fl s
This flag disables the ssh(1)'s strict host key checking. For more info see the ssh(1) manual page.
.It Fl v
This flag makes the output more verbose.
.It Fl o Ar directory 
This option creates files in "directory" named after each host name listed in the "hosts" file and saves the output received from the remotely executed command there.
.It Fl u Ar username
This forces ssh to use the supplied username instead of the username of the current user or the user specified in the host list.
.It Fl f Ar hosts
A file containing a list of hosts to whom we are going to connect. One host per line. Lines starting with # are skipped. You may also specify a user to connect as with the user@host format.
.It Fl p Ar procs
Spawn up-to "procs" number of ssh processes in parallel.
